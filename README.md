# Vulnerability

This script gives an example of how compute vulnerability metric, by using generated random variables, and particularly the following steps:
- Rescaling the values of vulnerability components by three methods (max-min linear rescaling ; log(x+1)-tranformed and rescaled between 0-1 ; percentile rank transformation).
- Quantification of vulnerability index relative from positive and negative ideal solutions.
