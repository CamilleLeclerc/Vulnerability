# Vulnerability

ðŸ“¦ R code example to compute vulnerability metric used in [Leclerc *et al.* (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13441).

---

``` Vulnerability_index_computation.R ``` gives an example of how compute vulnerability metric, by using generated random variables. The script contains the following steps:
- Rescaling the values of vulnerability components by three methods (max-min linear rescaling ; log(x+1)-tranformed and rescaled between 0-1 ; percentile rank transformation).
- Quantification of vulnerability index relative from positive and negative ideal solutions.
